# this is Sukky Yan Week 7 Homework

# TOPIC: Computer Vision sketch
# NAME: SHAMATE Filter - a makeup game
# TEAM: Asheley Ma, Sukky Yan

# BACKGROUND:
# This project is insipired from a Chinese urban phenomenon: SHAMATE — named after a deliberately nonsensical transliteration of the English word "smart". It is a young urban migrant from one of the tens of thousands of podunk towns scattered across China. These men and women are in their late teens or early 20s, often with middle-school educations and few marketable skills, working low-paying jobs in the big cities, like a barber, security guard, deliveryman, or waitress.
# These people have exaggerated hairstyle: curly perms, shaggy blow-outs, or spiky do’s, all held together with considerable abuse of hair coloring or wax. No doubt their spiky hair and body piercings have been a laughing matter to their neighbors.
# Shamate’s outré fashion choices reflect something much deeper: collective alienation, a byproduct of China’s massive urban migration push and the country’s widening class divide. 

# SET UP:
# We used ML5 as our pj5 library to realize the PoseNet model.It allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation. 

# APPROACH:
# After creating the key ingredients of shamate: colorful hair & exaggerated eyelash, we used the function 'preload' to input image.

# challenges:
# We tracked face using the point of eyes and nose, so the position of hair is not perfect.
